# Barcode Scanner Implementation Guide

## Overview

The POS system now includes comprehensive barcode scanning functionality that supports both manual input and camera-based scanning. This implementation provides a seamless experience for retail operations with multiple input methods and keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.

## Features

### 1. Dual Input Modes
- **Manual Mode**: Traditional text input for barcode scanners or manual entry
- **Camera Mode**: Real-time camera scanning using device camera

### 2. Advanced Scanning Capabilities
- Real-time barcode detection using ZXing library
- Support for multiple barcode formats (CODE128, EAN, UPC, etc.)
- Continuous scanning mode for high-volume operations
- Audio feedback for successful/failed scans

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **F1** or **Ctrl+B**: Focus barcode scanner
- **F2** or **Ctrl+S**: Focus search input
- **F9** or **Ctrl+C**: Clear current order
- **F12** or **Ctrl+Enter**: Place order (when items are in cart)

### 4. User Experience Features
- Visual scanning overlay with corner indicators
- Real-time feedback for scan results
- Stock validation before adding items
- Duplicate scan prevention
- Sound notifications for scan events

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### 1. BarcodeScanner Component (`components/POS/BarcodeScanner.tsx`)
Main component providing dual-mode scanning functionality.

**Props:**
- `products: Product[]` - Array of available products
- `onProductScanned: (product: Product) => void` - Callback when product is found
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes

**Features:**
- Toggle between manual and camera modes
- Real-time camera preview with scanning overlay
- Manual input with Enter key support
- Error handling for camera permissions
- Automatic focus management

#### 2. useBarcodeScanner Hook (`hooks/useBarcodeScanner.ts`)
Reusable hook for barcode scanning logic.

**Features:**
- ZXing library initialization
- Camera stream management
- Audio feedback system
- Product lookup and validation
- Scan history tracking

#### 3. KeyboardShortcuts Component (`components/POS/KeyboardShortcuts.tsx`)
Provides keyboard shortcuts for efficient POS operation.

**Features:**
- Global keyboard event handling
- Context-aware shortcut activation
- Visual shortcut reference panel
- Accessibility considerations

### Integration Points

#### POS System Integration
The barcode scanner is integrated into the main POS component (`components/POS/PointOfSale.tsx`):

```typescript
// Product scanning handler
const handleProductScanned = (product: Product) => {
  const newOrderLineItem = {
    id: product.id,
    name: product.name,
    price: product.productPrice,
    qty: 1,
    productThumbnail: product.productThumbnail,
    stock: product.stockQty,
  };
  dispatch(addProductToOrderLine(newOrderLineItem));
};

// Component usage
<BarcodeScanner
  ref={barcodeScannerRef}
  products={products}
  onProductScanned={handleProductScanned}
  className="mb-4"
/>
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Cashiers

#### Manual Scanning Mode
1. Ensure the scanner is in "Manual" mode (default)
2. Use a handheld barcode scanner to scan product barcodes
3. The scanned code will appear in the input field
4. Press Enter or click "Add" to add the product to the cart
5. The input field will clear automatically for the next scan

#### Camera Scanning Mode
1. Click the "Camera" button to switch modes
2. Allow camera permissions when prompted
3. Point the camera at a barcode within the green overlay
4. The system will automatically detect and add products
5. Keep the camera steady for best results
6. Click "Stop Camera" when finished

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Press **F1** to quickly focus the barcode scanner
- Press **F2** to focus the search field
- Press **F9** to clear the current order
- Press **F12** to place the order (when ready)

### For Developers

#### Adding New Barcode Formats
The ZXing library supports multiple formats. To add support for additional formats:

```typescript
// In useBarcodeScanner.ts
const { BrowserMultiFormatReader, BarcodeFormat } = await import('@zxing/browser');
const codeReader = new BrowserMultiFormatReader();

// Configure specific formats if needed
codeReader.hints.set(DecodeHintType.POSSIBLE_FORMATS, [
  BarcodeFormat.CODE_128,
  BarcodeFormat.EAN_13,
  BarcodeFormat.UPC_A,
  // Add more formats as needed
]);
```

#### Customizing Audio Feedback
Audio feedback can be customized in the `useBarcodeScanner` hook:

```typescript
// Success sound (higher pitch)
playSound(800, 200);

// Error sound (lower pitch)
playSound(400, 500);

// Custom sound
playSound(frequency, duration);
```

#### Error Handling
The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Camera permission denied
- Camera not available
- Barcode scanning library not supported
- Product not found
- Out of stock products

## Browser Compatibility

### Camera Scanning Requirements
- **HTTPS**: Camera access requires secure context (HTTPS)
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 53+, Firefox 36+, Safari 11+, Edge 12+
- **Mobile Support**: iOS Safari 11+, Chrome Mobile 53+

### Fallback Behavior
- If camera is not available, the system automatically falls back to manual mode
- Manual mode works on all browsers that support basic JavaScript
- Keyboard shortcuts work on all desktop browsers

## Security Considerations

### Camera Permissions
- Camera access is requested only when needed
- Permissions are handled gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- Camera stream is properly cleaned up when not in use

### Data Privacy
- No video data is stored or transmitted
- Barcode scanning happens locally in the browser
- Product lookups use existing product database

## Performance Optimization

### Camera Stream Management
- Camera stream is started only when needed
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Optimized video resolution for scanning performance

### Scanning Performance
- Continuous scanning with throttling to prevent excessive processing
- Duplicate scan prevention
- Efficient product lookup using product codes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
1. Check browser permissions for camera access
2. Ensure the site is served over HTTPS
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if other applications are using the camera

#### Barcode Not Recognized
1. Ensure good lighting conditions
2. Hold the barcode steady within the green overlay
3. Try different angles or distances
4. Verify the barcode is supported (CODE128, EAN, UPC)
5. Use manual mode as fallback

#### Performance Issues
1. Close other camera applications
2. Reduce browser tab count
3. Check device performance and available memory
4. Switch to manual mode for better performance

### Error Messages

- **"Camera scanning not supported"**: Browser doesn't support camera API
- **"Unable to access camera"**: Permission denied or camera in use
- **"Product not found"**: Barcode doesn't match any products
- **"Out of stock"**: Product found but no inventory available

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Batch Scanning**: Scan multiple items quickly
2. **Inventory Integration**: Real-time stock updates
3. **Analytics**: Scanning performance metrics
4. **Custom Sounds**: User-configurable audio feedback
5. **Barcode Generation**: Generate barcodes for new products

### API Extensions
1. **Webhook Integration**: Real-time inventory updates
2. **External Scanner Support**: Integration with professional scanners
3. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile scanning application

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
```json
{
  "@zxing/library": "^0.20.0",
  "@zxing/browser": "^0.1.1",
  "react": "^18.0.0",
